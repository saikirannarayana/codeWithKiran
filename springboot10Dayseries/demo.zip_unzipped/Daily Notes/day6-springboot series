🚀 Day 6: Spring Boot Learning Journey 🚀

Today, I made some significant strides in my Spring Boot project. I tackled exception handling and logger configuration and worked through some Gradle build issues.

💡 What I Worked On:

Exception Handling: Implemented custom exception handling to manage errors more effectively, including cases where input is invalid (e.g., name cannot be "kiran"). Although I haven't fully mastered custom exceptions yet, I made progress by learning to throw and handle exceptions in Spring Boot.
Logger Configuration: Added logging to my application to trace execution and understand the flow of data, which is crucial for debugging and monitoring.
Gradle Build Time: Explored ways to optimize build times in Gradle to improve development efficiency.
🔍 Challenges Faced:

Gradle Build Time: I’m still working on optimizing Gradle build times to speed up development.
Exception Handling Details: While I’ve set up basic exception handling, I’m continuing to refine my understanding of custom exceptions and their management.
Logger Setup: Configuring and using loggers effectively was a learning curve, but it’s helping me keep track of application behavior.
